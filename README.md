# 🚀 Solidity Quickstart

Solidity Quickstart is an extensive solidity guide for the solidity newbies out there.

## 🤔 How does it work?

All the guides are present in the [`contracts`](https://github.com/Kira272921/solidity-quickstart/tree/main/contracts) folder. At the end of each guide, there is a small challenge, which you would be completing a submitting in our discord server. 👀 You would be getting free XSol's (XSol is our [X Days Of Solidity](https://twitter.com/hashtag/XDaysOfSolidity) cryptocurrency)
