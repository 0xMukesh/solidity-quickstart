Before working with Solidity, we would have to set up our development environment in such a way that we could local test them ðŸš€.

## ðŸ‘€ Magical powers of Hardhat

We would be using a tool called [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). This would create a local Ethereum network and give us fake test ETH and fake test accounts to work with. Sounds interesting right ? So what are you waiting so letâ€™s set up hardhat ðŸš€.

-   Create a new folder for the project
    ```bash
    mkdir my-project
    ```
-   Navigate into that folder
    ```bash
    cd my-project
    ```
-   Initializing the project

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

    -   If you get an error saying `bash: npm: command not found` then go ahead and install nodejs from https://nodejs.org

-   Installing Hardhat

    ```bash
     npx hardhat
    ```

    You would be presented with a prompt something like this

    Let's choose the first option and press enter for the rest of the options

-   We would have to install few other dependencies as well

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev chai ethereum-waffle @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
    ```

    [`chai`](https://npmjs.com/package/chai) is a testing library.

    [`ethereum-waffle`](https://npmjs.com/package/ethereum-waffle) is the waffle package by which you can test your smart contracts.

    [`@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle) allows to test smart contracts using waffle and hardhat.

    [`ethers`](https://npmjs.com/package/ethers) is a library for complete Ethereum wallet implementation.

    [`@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers) is a hardhat plugin for ethers.

    You have successfully setupâ€™ed Hardhat ðŸ¥³.
